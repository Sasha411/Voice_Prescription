## About
Voice prescription is a health care and biomedical field-based web platform. This application is a helping hand for doctors, as it will provide a platform for creating a written prescription for patients using their voice.

The doctor is the main user who will be able to create the prescription using speech to text mechanism by using our website. Our website will save the prescription and will provide the doctor with its pdf file.

## Benefits

Quality of care: Ability to capture a more complete, accurate patient story supports better clinical decision making.

Adapts to you: No matter how you work, we will be making our application both web and mobile-friendly.

Accurate Records: The application will help in avoiding handwritten mistakes and human errors.
